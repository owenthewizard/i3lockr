# i3lockr

Distort a screenshot and run `i3lock`.

### Requires i3lock >= 2.12

## Quick Start

### Releases

Signed binary releases are availible on the [releases page](https://github.com/owenthewizard/i3lockr/releases),
built automatically by [GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/owenthewizard/i3lockr/actions).

### Debug Builds

[GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/owenthewizard/i3lockr/actions) makes the latest debug artifact available.

### Build it Yourself

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/owenthewizard/i3lockr.git && cd i3lockr
cargo build --release # you may adjust features here
target/release/i3lockr --blur 25 -- --nofork --ignore-empty-password # use your favorite args
```

## Screenshots

Without `--blur`

With `--blur=10`

With `--blur=25`

`i3lockr` (since v1.0.0) is incredibly fast at all blur levels!
You can check how long each step takes with `-v`.

### Coding Style

Obey `rustfmt` and Rust 2021 conventions, as well as `clippy` lints.
